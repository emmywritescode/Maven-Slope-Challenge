# Maven Slopes Challenge
![](intro.jpg)
## Introduction
This is a Power BI project on the Maven Slopes Challenge organized by Maven Analytics. The goal of the project is to help skiers find their ideal destination.
## Skills demonstrated
The following Power BI skills were incorporated into this project:
- Data transformation using Power Query Editor.
- Knowledge of DAX functions.
- Data Visualization on Power BI.
## Data sourcing
The data set provided by Maven Analytics contained data on 499 ski resorts in 5 continents and 38 countries of the world (resorts.csv). It also included complementary data on the snow cover around the world during each month of 2022 (snow.csv) and the data dictionary. Here's the link to the [data set](https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Ski+Resorts/Ski+Resorts.zip)
## Data Transformation
First, it was observed that the data needed to be cleaned. Characters like question marks, forward slashes, hyphens, and underscore were found to be overused in the 'Resort' column of the 'resorts.csv' data set and this was cleaned. Additionally, custom columns were created to provide a better interpretation of this data set.
## Solving the Problem
One major challenge for skiers would be the difficulty of finding the best ski resort based on the facilities available such as Longest runs, Highest Points, Lowest Points
